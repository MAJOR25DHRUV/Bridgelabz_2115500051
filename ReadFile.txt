Why is StringBuilder Faster?
Immutable Strings: Regular string is immutable, so every += creates a new object.
Efficient Memory Usage: StringBuilder modifies an existing buffer instead of creating new objects.
Lower Garbage Collection: Fewer objects are created, reducing memory overhead.
This demonstrates why StringBuilder is the preferred choice for frequent string modifications. ðŸš€
